	<p> Jordan's are typically basketball shoes and is made to be put through a lot like quick turns jumping and fast lateral movement. The shoes continue to last no matter what. If the wouldn't last the MJ wouldn't have played in them for so long. So, for people who dont play basketball and just wear the shoes for shoe they are going to last a long time. Jordans will last you years as long as you take care of them and clean them every now and then. Jordnas can last years in fact some people keep Jordans for 20+ years!
